No. We are not and have never been owned by Google or any other entity. We have been an independent company since our founding in 2008. You may notice content originally from Google, such as YouTube videos, in our search results. Even though Google has a monopoly on access to this content, we are able to get it anonymously via indirect sources. This ensures we still offer quality search results without needing to rely on Google directly for any of it. We also offer an extension for Google Chrome and a Google Android app, but these are not in partnership with Google -- and actually aim to protect you from Googleâ€™s online trackers.
