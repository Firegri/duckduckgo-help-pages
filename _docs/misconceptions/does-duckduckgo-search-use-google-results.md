No. DuckDuckGo has no relationship with Google. You may notice content originally from Google, such as YouTube videos, in our search results. Even though Google has a monopoly on access to this content, we are able to get it anonymously via indirect sources. This ensures we still offer quality search results without needing to rely on Google directly for any of it. We also offer an extension for Google Chrome and an app for Android devices, but these are not in partnership with Google – and actually aim to protect you from Google’s online trackers.
