No. DuckDuckGo has no relationship with Google. You may notice content originally from Google, such as YouTube videos, in our search results. This content is necessary for quality search results, but Google has a monopoly on access to it. However, we get it anonymously via indirect sources, not from Google directly. We also offer an extension for Google Chrome and an app for Android devices, but these are not in partnership with Google – and actually aim to protect you from Google’s online trackers.
