Yes, the DuckDuckGo Browser for {% include ddg-browser-os-list-linked.md %} is an alternative to Google Chrome and other browsers that lets you take back control of your personal information.

Every day, millions of people [choose DuckDuckGo over Chrome and other browsers](https://duckduckgo.com/compare-privacy) to search and browse online. Our built-in search engine is like Google but never tracks your searches. And our browsing protections, such as ad tracker blocking and cookie blocking, help stop other companies from collecting your data. Oh, and our browser is free â€” we make money from [privacy-respecting search ads]({{ site.baseurl }}/company/how-duckduckgo-makes-money/), not by exploiting your data.

Our private search engine is also independently accessible at [duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com) and as a built-in option for other popular browsers.
