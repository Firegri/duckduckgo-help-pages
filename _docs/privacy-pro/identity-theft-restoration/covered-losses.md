## How does it help recover my financial losses?

For U.S. subscribers, we'll work with financial institutions to help reverse any fraudulent transactions and reimburse certain expenses incurred throughout the restoration process. The reimbursement benefit is only available to U.S. subscribers, and is underwritten by an authorized insurance company under insurance policies issued to [Iris]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy-pro/identity-theft-restoration/iris/). Please review the [Summary of Benefits](https://duckduckgo.com/static-assets/files/pages/identity-theft-restoration/Summary_of_Benefits.pdf) to understand the full coverage terms, conditions, and exclusions. And while case managers canâ€™t work with financial institutions outside the U.S. directly, they can provide guidance to subscribers in all regions as you navigate the recovery process.

If you suspect that your credit or debit card information is being used fraudulently, please contact Iris so that an advisor can start researching your case and work with your bank to help resolve the situation. You can do so by navigating to **Settings** in the DuckDuckGo browser, go to the **Privacy Pro** section, and click on **Identity Theft Restoration**.
