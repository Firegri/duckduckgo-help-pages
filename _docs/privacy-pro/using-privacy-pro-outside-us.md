## Is DuckDuckGo VPN available outsidethe U.S.?

Yes, all Privacy Pro subscribers can use the DuckDuckGo VPN on up to five devices at once. We offer [VPN server locations worldwide]({{ site.baseurl}}/privacy-pro/vpn/servers).

## Is Identity Theft Restoration available outside the U.S.?

Yes, [Identity Theft Restoration]({{ site.baseurl}}/privacy-pro/identity-theft-restoration) is available to all subscribers, though features and coverage vary by region. Regardless of region, all subscribers get a dedicated case manager to support you through the restoration process. In Canada, the E.U., and the U.K., reps don’t work directly with your financial institutions, but they'll provide expert guidance to help you navigate it all. Outside the U.S., Identity Theft Restoration services are available in English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German.

## Is Personal Information Removal available outside the U.S.?

No, [Personal Information Removal]({{ site.baseurl}}/privacy-pro/personal-information-removal) is not available outside the U.S. at this time. In the E.U. and other regions, regulations like GDPR limit how much data can be collected without consent in the first place. Because the U.S. is lacking similar legislation, data brokers and people search sites are a lot more prevalent of an issue.
