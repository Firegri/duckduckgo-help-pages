DuckDuckGo believes online privacy should be simple and accessible to all, and our [Privacy Policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy) reflects that. For example, we do not save or share your search or browsing history when you search on DuckDuckGo or use our apps and extensions. At the same time, if you contact us directly, for example, to get product support, we may hold some limited amount of your personal information that you voluntarily provide to us. We also offer some optional features that require limited amounts of personal information to function, for example your email address to provide you with <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/email-protection/what-is-duckduckgo-email-protection/">Email Protection</a>.

## Your Rights

As explained below, you retain rights to the limited personal information we may have about you. We’ve tried to keep things simple here by summarizing the rights of residents in privacy-protective jurisdictions, but please refer to the privacy authorities in your specific location for more detailed information. While not all DuckDuckGo users have the legal rights described on this page, it is DuckDuckGo’s policy to honor these rights for our users as described regardless of where you live. We’ll do this to the best of our ability and take applicable law into consideration.

-   **Right To Not Receive Discriminatory Treatment:** We will not discriminate against you because you exercise any of your privacy rights.
-   **Right To Delete:** You have the right to request that we delete any information we may hold about you, but we will retain information we need for legal compliance.
-   **Right To Access:** You may ask us what information we may hold about you, categories of any third parties to whom we disclose the information (if any), and the business or commercial purpose for obtaining and sharing your information (if shared).
-   **Right To Correct Inaccurate Personal Data:** You may ask us to correct inaccurate information we hold about you.
-   **Right To Information About Processing:** You may request information about how personal information we may hold about you is processed (if at all), categories of individuals who may have access to it, and its retention period.
-   **Right To Request Limited Processing:** You may object and request that we limit the processing of your personal information.
-   **Right To Withdraw Consent:** If you consented to providing us information, you may withdraw consent at any time. The withdrawal of your consent does not affect the validity of any processing prior to withdrawal.
