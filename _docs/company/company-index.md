At DuckDuckGo, we believe the best way to protect your personal information from hackers, scammers, and privacy-invasive companies is to stop it from being collected at all. That's why millions of people [choose DuckDuckGo over Chrome and other browsers](https://duckduckgo.com/compare-privacy) to search and browse online. Our [built-in search engine](https://duckduckgo.com) is like Google but never tracks your searches. And our browsing protections, such as ad tracker blocking and cookie blocking, help stop other companies from collecting your data. Oh, and [our browser](https://duckduckgo.com/app) is free â€” we make money from [privacy-respecting search ads]({{ site.baseurl }}/company/how-duckduckgo-makes-money/), not by exploiting your data. Take back control of your personal information with the browser designed for data protection, not data collection.
